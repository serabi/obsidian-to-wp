# Obsidian -> WordPress: An Obsidian Publishing Plugin for WordPress

Publish your Obsidian notes directly to WordPress as Gutenberg block-formatted posts. This plugin converts Obsidian-flavored markdown (including callouts, wikilinks, and standard formatting) into WordPress block markup, handles image uploads to your WordPress media library, and authenticates securely using Application Passwords.

## Features

- **One-click publishing** - Publish notes via command palette or right-click context menu
- **Gutenberg block output** - Converts markdown to native WordPress block format
- **Image uploads** - Automatically uploads local images to WordPress media library
- **Folder scoping** - Restrict publishing to notes in a specific folder
- **Frontmatter control** - Set post properties like title, slug, categories, tags, excerpt, and scheduled date
- **Post status control** - Publish as draft, published, private, or scheduled (per-post or default setting)
- **Update support** - Re-publish notes to update existing WordPress posts

## Installation

### Using BRAT (recommended for beta testing)

1. Install [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) from Obsidian Community Plugins
2. Open **Settings > BRAT > Add Beta plugin**
3. Enter the repository URL: `serabi/obsidian-to-wp`
4. Select **Add Plugin**
5. Enable the plugin in **Settings > Community plugins**

BRAT will automatically check for updates and keep your plugin current.

### Manual Installation

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest release
2. Create a folder named `obsidian-to-wp` in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory
3. Copy the downloaded files into this folder
4. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings > Community plugins**

## Setup

### WordPress Configuration

1. Ensure your WordPress site has the REST API enabled (enabled by default in WordPress 4.7+)
2. Create an Application Password:
   - Go to **Users > Profile** in WordPress admin
   - Scroll to **Application Passwords**
   - Enter a name (e.g., "Obsidian Publisher") and click **Add New Application Password**
   - Copy the generated password to someplace safe, like a password manager (you won't see it again)

### Plugin Settings

1. Open Obsidian **Settings > Obsidian to WordPress**
2. Enter your WordPress site URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
3. Enter your WordPress username
4. Enter the Application Password you created
5. Click **Test** to verify the connection
6. Optionally configure:
   - **Publishable folder** - Only notes in this folder can be published
   - **Default post status** - Draft, Published, or Private
   - **Upload images** - Toggle automatic image uploads

## Usage

### Publishing a Note

**Option 1: Command Palette**
1. Open the note you want to publish
2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + P` to open the command palette
3. Search for "Publish current note to WordPress"
4. Press Enter

**Option 2: Context Menu**
1. Right-click on a note in the file explorer
2. Select **Publish to WordPress**

Or right-click in the editor and select **Publish to WordPress**.

### Frontmatter Options

Control post properties using YAML frontmatter at the top of your note:

```yaml
---
title: My Blog Post Title
slug: my-custom-url-slug
status: draft
categories:
  - Technology
  - Tutorials
tags:
  - obsidian
  - wordpress
excerpt: A brief summary of my post for previews and SEO
date: 2024-12-25T10:00:00
---
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | Post title (defaults to filename) |
| `slug` | URL slug/permalink |
| `status` | `draft`, `publish`, `private`, or `future` |
| `categories` | List of category names (created if they don't exist) |
| `tags` | List of tag names (created if they don't exist) |
| `excerpt` | Post excerpt/summary |
| `date` | Scheduled publish date (ISO 8601 format, requires `status: future`) |
| `wp_post_id` | WordPress post ID (auto-set after first publish) |

### Updating Published Posts

After publishing a note, the plugin adds a `wp_post_id` field to the frontmatter. Subsequent publishes will update the existing WordPress post instead of creating a new one.

## Markdown Support

The plugin converts the following Obsidian markdown elements to Gutenberg blocks:

| Obsidian | WordPress Block |
|----------|----------------|
| Headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) | Heading block |
| Paragraphs | Paragraph block |
| Code blocks | Code block |
| Blockquotes (`>`) | Quote block |
| Unordered lists (`-`, `*`) | List block |
| Ordered lists (`1.`, `2.`) | List block (ordered) |
| Images (`![]()`, `![[]]`) | Image block |
| Callouts (`> [!note]`) | Quote block with callout styling |
| Horizontal rules (`---`) | Separator block |

### Inline Formatting

- **Bold** (`**text**`)
- *Italic* (`*text*`)
- ~~Strikethrough~~ (`~~text~~`)
- `Inline code` (`` `code` ``)
- ==Highlights== (`==text==`)
- [Links](url) (`[text](url)`)
- Wikilinks are converted to plain text

## Roadmap

### Planned Features

- **Two-way sync** - Pull WordPress posts back into Obsidian
- Featured image support
- Custom post type support
- Bulk publishing
- Publishing status indicators in file explorer
- Conflict detection and resolution

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

- Verify your site URL includes `https://` (if applicable) and has no trailing slash
- Ensure the username matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that Application Passwords are enabled on your WordPress site
- Some security plugins may block REST API access - check your plugin settings

### Images Not Uploading

- Verify the image files exist in your vault
- Check that the images use supported formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
- Ensure your WordPress user has media upload permissions

### Post Not Appearing

- Check if the post was created as a draft (look in **Posts > All Posts** and filter by status)
- Verify categories exist or check if they were created with correct names
